This is a personal project for iOS programming practice. It is also used as a prototype for A2J Hackathon: https://www.a2jhackathon.net

### Prerequisites

This project cannot be run probably beacuse the API key is hidden.

### What I have tried?

- Dialog Flow API
- Apple MapKits
- Firebase database
- Google News API
- Microsoft Vision
